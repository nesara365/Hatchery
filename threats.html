  <h1>Threats</h1>
  <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. Five primary risks to sea turtles globally have been recognized by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group: fishing bycatch, coastal development, pollution and infections, direct take, and climate change. Find out more about these threats and how you can assist.</p>

  <h1>1.Fisheries bycatch</h1>
  <br><br>
  <div class="Content01">
      <p>Thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles are thought to perish each year as a result of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded as bycatch. Additionally, the disruption to their food supply and environment has an effect on those who are able to evade fishing nets.
        <br><br>
        This can also be prevented by altering fishing techniques, avoiding migratory routes or locations with high concentrations of different species, or fishing at different depths.</p>

  <h1>2.Coastal development</h1>
  <br><br>
  <div class="Content02">
      <p>Because of receding coasts, sea turtle habitats are devastated every year. Sea turtle food sources and nesting areas are severely impacted anywhere there is boat vessel traffic, anytime a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and everywhere the sea floor is dug up and the beach erodes.
        <br><br>
        To prevent this you can lessen the likelihood that waves will carry sand off your land by growing flora that thrives near beaches .Living shorelines combine living elements like plants with structural ones like seawalls to stabilize a shore.</p>

  <h1>3.Pollution</h1>
  <br><br>
  <div class="Content03">
      <p>Sea turtles are harmed by marine pollution in a number of ways. Sea turtles are harmed by ingesting and being entangled in waste such as plastic trash, fishing gear left out to sea, petroleum byproducts, and other objects. The immune systems of the turtles may be weakened by ocean pollution, which may also interfere with nesting habits and hatchling orientation.
        <br><br>
        to prevent we can start by planting native species, manually removing invasive plant species, and tearing down old fences, you can work with organizations in your community to restore natural forests, grasslands, and coastal ecosystems.

  <h1>4.Direct take</h1>
  <br><br>
   <div class="Content04">
          <p>Turtles are murdered all over the world and sold as unusual food, oil, leather, and jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been slaughtered over the past century only for the value of their shells. Even while efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the global trade in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

   <h1>5.Climate Change</h1>
   <br><br>
  <div class="Content05">
      <p>The extent to which sea turtles can be impacted by climate change is only now coming to light. Climate change has the potential to alter the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, raise the risk of disease outbreaks, and increase the frequency of extreme weather conditions that devastate coral reefs and beaches used for nesting.
      <br><br>
      Asking where and how your seafood was caught will help you become an informed and ethical seafood consumer. Select seafood that has not been caught by hurting or killing turtles. To find out how and where your seafood is caught, use networks of information on sustainable seafood.
